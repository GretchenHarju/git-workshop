## History
<img src="images/graph-theory.png" width="600px" />
</br>
<p width="600px">In 1736 Leonhard Euler solved a navigation question by creating what eventually becomes graph theory.</p>


## Directed Graphs

</br>
<p width="600px">A directed graph consists of nodes and edges that connect nodes with specified directionality. Directionality determines a pathway to reaching nodes.</p>


## Commits as Nodes

</br>
Commits are nodes in a directed graph and typically have:
 - metadata including author, SHA id, message & date created
 - snapshot state of the files the repository manages
 - directed edge towards a parent node


## Logs as Graphs

</br>
<p width="600px">Git leverages references in the form of branches and tags. References make commits reachable.</p>


## Referable Pathways
<img src="images/graph-branches.png" width="600px" />
</br>
<p width="600px">Commit nodes have edges that point to a parent commit. This, along with branches and tags, form referable pathways through specific snapshots of the repository.</p>
